# Vision-based-Hand-Gesture-Recognition-for-Mouse-Control
Developed an advanced vision-based hand gesture recognition system for precise and intuitive mouse control using real-time computer vision and hand tracking algorithms.

Engineered an innovative hand gesture-driven system utilizing computer vision, empowering users to control the mouse through intuitive finger movements captured by a webcam and processed via MediaPipe.
Designed advanced algorithms for seamless execution of left-click, right-click, and scrolling functionalities by analyzing hand landmark coordinates and calculating dynamic finger positions.
Implemented sophisticated smoothing algorithms to enhance cursor precision, ensuring fluid and responsive control by mapping hand movements to screen dimensions, with real-time gesture interpretation and interaction.
